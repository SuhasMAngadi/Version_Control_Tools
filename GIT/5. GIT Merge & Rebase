GIT Merge: Merges different branches without effecting the history

Syntax:  git merge <branchname>

- Non-destructive operation and preserves history
- Existing branches are not changed in any way, but simply merged together
- All the commits on a feature branch are combined into a single commit on the master branch
- Best used when target branch is shared

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

GIT Rebase: Integrates the changes from one branch into another

Syntax:  git rebase <branchname>

- Moves the feature branch to begin on the end of master branch
- Re-writes project history
- Linear and cleaner project history is obtained
- Best used when target branch is private
